# SudoCoin Client v0.02 BETA
This is a fucntioning client created in C# for easy use/navigation of Sudocoin (SDC).

# Features
It has an inbuilt browser, which immediatly directs to the SudoCoin homepage. Here users can interact freely with just the homepage.
(Future Update) A wallet helps users keep track of all their SDC. Currently, the wallet is not active, and acts almost like a placeholder.
(Future Update) A miner will be built into the application, to help mine SDC easily. Again, this feature isn't active, but will hopefully work in a future update. It currently tracks the user defined price of SDC, which is likely to change from time-to-time.
The store allows users to buy goods with SDC, which are published by users manually.
The client allows users to read the full API, obtained from the SDC website.
And, with a sign-up button, users will (in the future) be able to mine SDC, use their account to keep track of their SDC and recieve transactions from other users.
